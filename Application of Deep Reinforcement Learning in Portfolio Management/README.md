# Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in Portfolio Management

## Introduction

This is my work on Statistical Research Project at Imperial College London. 
I have started this project since late May 2024, and the deadline for the project is late August. 
This project is supervised by Dr Ciara Pike-Burke. 

The aim of the project is to compare various deep reinforcement learning algorithms that are used for portfolio management and develop my own model. 
Mainly I test three algorithms: Deep Q Network, Proximal Policy Optimisation, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.

The environment is designed using OpenAI Gym.
